state "Created" as created
created: funding tx
created: in mempool
note right of created
    A child of a banned
    input may start in
    the banned stated.
    
    For simplicity, and
    because destroying
    UTXOs incurs a cost,
    we illustrate a DoS
    policy that doesn't
    take provenance into
    account.
end note
state "Mined" as mined
mined: funding tx
mined: confirmed
note left of destroyed
    For simplicity reorgs
    are not shown, so the
    mined and destroyed
    states assume sufficient
    confirmation depth.
end note
state "Spent" as spent
spent: spending tx
spent: in mempool
state "Destroyed" as destroyed
destroyed: spending tx
destroyed: confirmed

        DoS prevention policy
        
        De-registration and timeouts
        follow this path, since
        repeated de-registration may
        suggest a DoS attack
        
        Repeated non-signing inputs
        strongly suggests DoS attempts
        but there's always plausible
        deniability due to connectivity
        issues, so bans should expire.
